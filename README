Yeti OS is a custom bit-sized linux distro for the RPi zero, cross-compiled
from scratch. It includes basic tools and configuration to develop the
system further. The scripts can be modified to compile it for other architectures.

=== BUILDING
============

Before you start building, you will need to set a few environment variables:

- DIST_ROOT -> this directory (root of this repository)
- CLFS -> DIST_ROOT/build_env/build_root
- CLFS_TARGET -> [TODO: see if this variable is even used]
- LFS_HN -> the desired hostname for the finished system

Then run build.sh.

=== BOOTING
===========

The build script provided generates a root filesystem. There are a few methods to
install it and boot from the generated root filesystem:

- Install another Pi OS onto your SDCard (e.g PiLFS), and replace the root filesystem with
  the newly built Yeti OS filesystem

- This guide shows another way to boot from the root filesystem:

=== PACKAGES
============

The Yeti Package Manager is used for package management and is built into the system by the
build script. However, you can use any package manager with Yeti. See https://github.com/AVS-Origami/ypm
for more information on the Yeti Package Manager.
